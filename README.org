* Seam Carving

This was a final project in my Msc. I reimplemented the classic seam-carving algorithm from [[Shai Avidan, Ariel Shamir][https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1275808.1276390]] in JuliaLang, and implemented an addition to the energy function that incorporated the semantic weights from MaskRCNN to better avoid people, faces, and other semantically meaningfull objects that the pretrained MaskRCNN can detect.
