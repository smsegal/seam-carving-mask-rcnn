* Notes for Report
Trying to solve the problem of adaptive image resizing preserving semantic
content at its relative intensities. Previous attempts use seam carving for
adaptive image resize, but do not have higher order feature understanding. To
address this, we change the energy function by introducing a semantic
segmentation masking layer (produced my MaskRCNN) that scales the energies of
the gradients for pixels belonging to higher order features. This can include
people, animals, or common objects. Results are hopefully good.
